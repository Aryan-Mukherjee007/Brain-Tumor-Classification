This GitHub repository contains open source data from Kaggle of 7023 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images, as well as the code I implemented to fit a convolutional neural network to the data for multinomial classification. Here will be referenced all code from my machine learning research on brain tumors. The original data file can be found here:

Additionally, here is the link to my google colab, where the code can be run upon uploading the relevant data file:
